# Machine and Deep Learning Algorithms

### This repository contains essential codes and materials related to the Machine and Deep Learning areas.

Such materials helped me in order to develop my skills in the area as a MSc and PhD student.
Feel free to use any of the codes and the materials to improve yourself and to help other people to learn (Don't forget to cite me, haha).
