    "This chapter is quite heavy by its size and its content but I did what I could to make it more intuitive and visual. We will see how to represent systems of equations graphically, how to interpret the number of solutions of a system, what is linear combination and more. As usual, we will use **Numpy/Matplotlib** as a tool to experiment these concepts and hopefully gain a more concrete understanding."
