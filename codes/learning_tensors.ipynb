    "When we represent **data** for machine learning, this generally needs to be done **numerically**. Especially when referring specifically of neural network data representation, this is accomplished via a data repository known as **the tensor**. A tensor is a container which can house data in N dimensions. Often and erroneously used interchangeably with the matrix (which is specifically a 2-dimensional tensor), tensors are generalizations of matrices to N-dimensional space."

Aside from holding numeric data, *tensors also include descriptions of the valid linear transformations between tensors*. Examples of such transformations, or relations, include the **cross product** and the **dot product**. From a computer science perspective, it can be helpful to think of tensors as being objects in an object-oriented sense, as opposed to simply being a data structure."

If we temporarily consider them simply to be data structures, below is an overview of where tensors fit in with scalars, vectors, and matrices, and some simple code demonstrating how Numpy can be used to create each of these data types. We will look at some tensor transformations in a subsequent post."
